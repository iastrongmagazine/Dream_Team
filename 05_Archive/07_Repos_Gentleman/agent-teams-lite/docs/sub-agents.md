# Sub-Agents & Skill Registry

## SDD Phase Sub-Agents

Each sub-agent is a SKILL.md file — pure Markdown instructions that any AI assistant can follow. The preferred path is for the orchestrator to pre-resolve relevant skills from the registry and inject compact rules into each sub-agent prompt. Sub-agents still support registry/path fallback for backward compatibility.

| Sub-Agent          | Skill File                | What It Does                                                                                  |

### Sub-Agent Result Contract

Each sub-agent must return a structured envelope with these fields:

| Field               | Description                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `status`            | `success`, `partial`, or `blocked`                          |
| `executive_summary` | 1-3 sentence summary of what was done                       |
| `detailed_report`   | (optional) Full phase output, or omit if already inline     |
| `artifacts`         | List of artifact keys/paths written                         |
| `next_recommended`  | The next SDD phase to run, or "none"                        |
| `risks`             | Risks discovered, or "None"                                 |
| `skill_resolution`  | `injected`, `fallback-registry`, `fallback-path`, or `none` |

Example:

```markdown
**Status**: success
**Summary**: Proposal created for `{change-name}`. Defined scope, approach, and rollback plan.
**Artifacts**: Engram `sdd/{change-name}/proposal` | `openspec/changes/{change-name}/proposal.md`
**Next**: sdd-spec or sdd-design
**Risks**: None
```

`executive_summary` is intentionally short. `detailed_report` can be as long as needed for complex architecture work.

### Sub-Agent Context Protocol

Sub-agents start with a **fresh context**. The orchestrator is responsible for resolving the skill registry once, matching relevant skills, and injecting compact rules into the sub-agent prompt as `## Project Standards (auto-resolved)`. If that block is missing, sub-agents fall back to registry lookup or explicit `SKILL: Load` paths.

Sub-agents are also instructed to save discoveries, decisions, and bug fixes to engram automatically (non-SDD sub-agents) or via the mandatory persist step (SDD phases).

## Shared Conventions

All skills reference three shared convention files in `skills/_shared/`. Critical engram calls (`mem_search`, `mem_save`, `mem_get_observation`) are also **inlined directly in each skill** so sub-agents don't need to follow multi-hop file references.

| File                      | Purpose                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `persistence-contract.md` | Mode resolution rules, sub-agent context protocol, skill registry loading protocol                                                                  |
| `engram-convention.md`    | Supplementary reference for deterministic naming (`sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}`) and two-step recovery. Critical calls are inlined in skills. |
| `openspec-convention.md`  | Filesystem paths for each artifact, directory structure, config.yaml reference, and archive layout                                                  |
| `skill-resolver.md`       | Universal protocol for delegators to inject compact rules from the skill registry                                                                   |

**Why inline + shared:**
- **Sub-agents fail multi-hop chains** — A 3-hop read chain (skill → convention file → actual instructions) breaks non-Claude models. Inlining the critical calls eliminates this.
- **Deterministic recovery** — Engram artifact naming follows a strict `sdd/{change}/{type}` convention with `topic_key`, so any skill can reliably find artifacts created by other skills.
- **Consistent mode behavior** — All skills resolve `engram | openspec | hybrid | none` the same way. `openspec` and `hybrid` are never chosen automatically.

---

## Skill Registry

Sub-agents start with a **fresh context** — they do not know what user skills exist (React, TDD, Playwright, etc.). The skill registry solves this, and the orchestrator uses it to inject compact rules before each delegation.

**How it works:**
1. `/sdd-init` or `/skill-registry` scans your installed skills and project conventions
2. Writes `.atl/skill-registry.md` in the project root (mode-independent, always created)
3. If engram is available, also saves to engram (cross-session bonus)
4. The orchestrator reads the registry once and caches the **Compact Rules** section plus the trigger table
5. For each delegation, the orchestrator injects matching rules as `## Project Standards (auto-resolved)`
6. Fallback order if standards were not injected: `mem_search(query: "skill-registry", project: "{project}")` → `.atl/skill-registry.md` → explicit `SKILL: Load` paths
7. Delegations report `skill_resolution` so the orchestrator can detect and repair cache loss after compaction

**Preferred path:** the orchestrator pre-resolves compact rules. Sub-agent self-loading is only a compatibility fallback.

**What it contains:**
- User skills table: trigger → skill name → path (e.g., "React components" → `react-19` → `~/01_Core/03_Skills/react-19/SKILL.md`)
- Compact rules blocks: short, pre-digested instructions that delegators paste directly into sub-agent prompts
- Project conventions found: `agents.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, etc.

**When to update:** Run `/skill-registry` after installing or removing skills.

## Per-Agent Model Routing

Each agent can have a `model` field in `opencode.json` that defines which model it should use. When the orchestrator delegates via `delegate(prompt, agent)` or `Task`, the background-agents plugin passes the `model` through to `session.prompt()`, so the sub-agent runs on its configured model.

**Example** (`opencode.multi.json`):

```json
{
  "sdd-explore": {
    "model": "<your-provider/your-model>",
    "mode": "subagent",
    ...
  },
  "sdd-spec": {
    "model": "<your-provider/your-model>",
    "mode": "subagent",
    ...
  }
}
```

For single-model setups (`opencode.single.json`), omit the `model` field entirely — all agents inherit OpenCode's global default model.

**Alternative: `@agent-name` text mentions.** OpenCode also supports routing via `@agent-name` mentions in the orchestrator's output, which triggers native agent routing. This is an alternative to `delegate()` but is NOT required — `delegate()` handles model routing correctly.
