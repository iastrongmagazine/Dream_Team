# Agent Teams Lite

> **This project has been deprecated in favor of [`gentle-ai`](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai).**
>
> Everything Agent Teams Lite provides — skills, orchestration, SDD workflow, skill registry — is now available through `gentle-ai` with a better installation experience, automatic updates, persistent memory via Engram, and support for **8 agents** out of the box.

## Migrating to gentle-ai

```bash
brew install gentleman-programming/tap/gentle-ai
gentle-ai install
```

That's it. `gentle-ai` detects your installed tools, installs all skills, configures MCP servers, injects the SDD orchestrator, and sets up Engram persistent memory — automatically.

### If you already have ATL installed

Run `gentle-ai install` — it will detect your existing setup and upgrade in place. Your skills, orchestrator config, and MCP servers will be migrated to the managed format with marker-based sections that support future sync and updates.

## Why deprecate?

Maintaining feature parity across two distribution channels (shell scripts + Go binary) was unsustainable. Every change to a skill, orchestrator, or asset had to be replicated manually. With `gentle-ai`:

- **One source of truth** — assets are embedded in the binary, versioned with the release
- **Atomic updates** — `brew upgrade gentle-ai && gentle-ai sync` refreshes everything
- **No drift** — marker-based injection replaces stale content instead of appending duplicates
- **Cross-session memory** — Engram protocol is injected into every agent's prompt automatically

## This repo is archived

No new features or bug fixes will be made here. All development continues in [`gentle-ai`](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai).

The code remains available for reference. If you find value in the patterns described in the docs, they are all implemented (and improved) in gentle-ai.
